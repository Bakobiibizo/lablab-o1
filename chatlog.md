Project Review
The cellium project is currently initialized with the following configuration:
Proposed Development Plan
Based on the project outline and requirements, here is a proposed plan to begin development:
Project Structure Setup
Organize the project into modules corresponding to the major components:
```
   cellium/
   ├── Cargo.toml
   └── src/
       ├── main.rs
       ├── api/
       │   └── mod.rs
       ├── data_ingestor/
       │   └── mod.rs
       ├── prompt_template/
       │   └── mod.rs
       ├── state_machine/
       │   └── mod.rs
       └── generator/
           └── mod.rs
```
Crate Dependencies
Update Cargo.toml with necessary dependencies:
Module Scaffolding
a. API Module (api/)
Define asynchronous request handlers for receiving and returning documents.
Set up routing and server initialization using warp.
b. Data Ingestor Module (data_ingestor/)
Define parsers for HTML, HTMX, Python, TypeScript, and JavaScript files.
Implement structures to represent parsed documents and file hierarchy mirroring.
c. Prompt Template Module (prompt_template/)
Create a template system with support for dynamic variables and state-based instructions.
Allow for easy swapping of prompts for different tasks.
d. State Machine Module (state_machine/)
Implement a state machine to manage agent contexts using the async-fsm pattern.
Define states, transitions, and actions based on the workflow steps.
e. Generator Module (generator/)
Set up communication with OpenAI's API using reqwest.
Implement functions to send prompts and receive generated text asynchronously.
Focus on API Development
Begin implementing the API module to establish the core workflow.
Set up basic endpoints and test the request-response cycle with mock data.
Testing Infrastructure
Use tokio::test for asynchronous unit tests.
Scaffold tests for each module to ensure functionality and catch regressions early.
Documentation and Scratchpad Update
Document the code using Rustdoc comments.
Update scratchpad.md with the current state and decisions made.
Key Considerations
Async Concurrency: Utilize tokio for managing asynchronous tasks and I/O operations across modules.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling using Result and custom error types where appropriate.
Modularity: Ensure code is organized into reusable functions and modules to promote scalability and maintainability.
Configuration Management: Use environment variables for configurations like API keys and URLs, possibly with the dotenv crate.
Next Steps
Please review this development plan and let me know if it meets your expectations or if any adjustments are needed. Upon your approval, I will proceed to set up the project structure and scaffold the modules as outlined.

USER: The development plan looks good lets proceed

AGENT: Module Scaffolding
1. API Module (api/mod.rs)
Scaffold the api module with placeholders for server setup and route definitions.
2. Data Ingestor Module (data_ingestor/mod.rs)
Scaffold the data_ingestor module with structures and methods for parsing documents.
3. Prompt Template Module (prompt_template/mod.rs)
Scaffold the prompt_template module to manage prompt templates.
4. State Machine Module (state_machine/mod.rs)
Scaffold the state_machine module with an enum for agent states and a state machine struct.
5. Generator Module (generator/mod.rs)
Scaffold the generator module with functions for LLM text generation.
Next Steps
Integrate Modules into main.rs: Update main.rs to include and initialize the modules.
Focus on API Development: Begin implementing the API module to set up the server and define endpoints.
Scaffold Tests: Create test files for each module and write unit tests using #[tokio::test].
---
Proposal
With the modules scaffolded, I propose to focus on the API component next, as per the development plan. This will involve:
Setting up the Warp server and defining routes for receiving documents.
Implementing request handlers that interact with the data ingestor.
Ensuring that the API can accept documents and return responses, even if the internal logic is mocked at this stage.
Please let me know if you approve proceeding with the API implementation or if you have any adjustments to suggest.

USER: additional requirements for the api have been added to the .env file located in the root of the project. 
These are the variables:
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- OPENAI_BASE_URL
- OPENAI_MODEL
- DATA_DIR

I believe that covers what you need but let me know if i missed anything

AGENT: Acknowledging Environment Variables and Proceeding
---
Thank you for providing the additional environment variables:
OPENAI_API_KEY
OPENAI_BASE_URL
OPENAI_MODEL
DATA_DIR
These variables cover the key configurations needed for the API and Generator modules, particularly for interacting with the OpenAI API and specifying the data directories.
Possible Additional Environment Variables
To ensure smooth operation and configurability of the API, we might consider adding the following environment variables:
SERVER_HOST: The hostname or IP address for the API server to bind to (e.g., 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0).
SERVER_PORT: The port number on which the API server will listen (e.g., 8080).
LOG_LEVEL: The logging level for the application (e.g., info, debug, error).
Would you like to include these additional environment variables?
---
Next Steps
With your approval, I will proceed to implement the API module, focusing on:
Server Setup: Configuring the Warp server to use SERVER_HOST and SERVER_PORT from the environment.
Endpoint Definitions: Defining endpoints for receiving documents and returning modified documents.
Environment Variable Handling: Loading environment variables securely and making them accessible throughout the application.
Integration with Other Modules: Ensuring that the API interacts correctly with the DataIngestor and other components.
Please let me know if you agree with adding the suggested environment variables or if you have any other preferences before we proceed

USER: I have added the variables as provided. The log level value is set to DEBUG, I am used to the pythonic norms but if this is not aligned with rust let me know. plan approved
